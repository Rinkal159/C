→ C is a procedural, general purpose and compiled programming language.

* Data types:
* __________

→ int
→ float
→ double
→ char
    (there is no string data type, 
    if i want to declare a string, than can be declared by array of characters. 
    e.g.
    char[] name = "Rinkal")

* printf with data types:
* _______________________

→ in C, only label is not enough to print the values after that sentence, we must define which values will be filling in that space.
→ usually in java we write like this: 
    System.out.print("Value of a is: " + a);

→ but in c we define like this(filing entire sentence in double quotes, define data type of value in the place of value):
    printf("Value of a is: %d" , a);
