→ C is a procedural, general purpose and compiled programming language.

* Data types:
* __________

→ int
→ float
→ double
→ char
    (there is no string data type, 
    if i want to declare a string, than can be declared by array of characters. 
    e.g.
    char[] name = "Rinkal")

* printf with data types:
* _______________________

→ in C, only label is not enough to print the values after that sentence, we must define which values will be filling in that space.
→ usually in java we write like this: 
    System.out.print("Value of a is: " + a);

→ but in c we define like this(filing entire sentence in double quotes, define data type of value in the place of value):
    printf("Value of a is: %d" , a);

Specifier  Data Type
_________  _________   
      
   %d       int               
   %f       float             
   %lf      double            
   %c       char              
   %s       string            
   %x       hexadecimal       
   %o       octal             
   %p       address (pointer) 

* Header files
* ____________

→ Ends with .h
→ if any header file containing functions, then it only containes functional declaration, not definition.

2 types of header files:
    → "System defined" header file:
        #incluse <stdio.h>
        written inside angular brackets

    → "User defined" header files:
        #include "sum.h"
        writte inside double quotes.

System defined header files:

stdio.h: input/output
stdlib.h: memory allocation
string.h: string functions
math.h: math functions
time.h: date and time
