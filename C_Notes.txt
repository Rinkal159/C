→ C is a procedural, general purpose and compiled programming language.

* Data types:
* __________

→ int
→ float
→ double
→ char
    (there is no string data type, 
    if i want to declare a string, than can be declared by array of characters. 
    e.g.
    char name[] = "Rinkal")

* printf with data types:
* _______________________

→ in C, only label is not enough to print the values after that sentence, we must define which values will be filled in that space.
→ usually in java we write like this: 
    System.out.print("Value of a is: " + a);

→ but in c we define like this(filing entire sentence in double quotes, define data type of value in the place of value):
    printf("Value of a is: %d" , a);

Specifier  Data Type
_________  _________   
      
   %d       int               
   %f       float             
   %lf      double            
   %c       char              
   %s       string            
   %x       hexadecimal       
   %o       octal             
   %p       address (pointer) 

* Types and memory holdage 
* ________________________

→ byte: 1 byte

→ char : 1 byte
        → 1 byte is equals to 128 bites, therefore it can store elements from 0 to 127 in positive and -1 to -128 in negative

→ int : 4 bytes
        → It can store roughly 4 billion values, 2 billion postive and 2 billion negative.

→ long : 8 byte

→ float : 4 byte

→ double : 8 byte

→ boolean : 1 byte

→ string : depends
        → if string contains three characters, then 4 byte, if 5 them 6 bytes, +1 because of \0

* Header files
* ____________

→ Ends with .h
→ if any header file containing functions, then it only containes functional declaration, not definition.

^→ 2 types of header files:
    → "System defined" header file:
        #incluse <stdio.h>
        written inside angular brackets

    → "User defined" header files:
        #include "sum.h"
        writte inside double quotes.

^System defined header files:

stdio.h: input/output
stdlib.h: memory allocation
string.h: string functions
math.h: math functions
time.h: date and time

* Function in C:
* ______________

→ It is same like java.

e.g.
int greet(charname[50]) {
    printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
}

→ Prototype: Function Declaration(return type, function name and parameter list)

* Array:
* ______

→ to find length of array: sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0])

^→ array of characters means strings:
    char arr[] = "ab";

    → in the form of array: 
        {'a', 'b', '\0'}
    
    → array of characters are null terminated, always ends with '\0' that is NUL and its ASCII value is 0, thats why arr[2] in %i results 0. 
    → array of characters always stores elements.length  + 1 in memory because of \0.

* ZERO OR ONE?
* ___________

^ In conditionals:

    → if the condition is "true", then returns "1".
    → but if the condition is "false", then returns "0".

^ In exit status:

    → if everythign works fine, no issue, then it returns "0".
    → but if there's some issue, then it returns "other than 0" but "positive" one.
